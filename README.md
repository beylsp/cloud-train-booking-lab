# cloud-train-booking-lab

This repository is a **personal learning project** focused on exploring **Kubernetes-based microservices** and **cloud-native application design and development**. It is organized as a series of **progressive chapters**, each building upon the previous one.

## Project Theme

The project is centered around building an **online train booking system**, which serves as the reference application throughout the chapters. This fictional platform includes typical components of a modern distributed system â€” such as order placement, tracking and notification services.
